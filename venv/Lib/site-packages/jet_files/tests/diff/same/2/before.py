# The return of artificial pitches to the Football League has been backed by club chairmen in League One and Two.
# At a meeting on Thursday they gave a strong indication they would vote in favour of permitting 3G ("third generation") surfaces from next season.
# They will take a formal vote in November.
# Artificial surfaces were banned from English professional football in 1995 over issues with ball roll and bounce and fears over long-term injuries.
# 3G or not 3G?
# 3G pitches consist of artificial blades supported by sand and rubber crumb
# They can be laid on various shock absorbing bases to suit different sports
# 3G pitches cost around Â£500,000 to install
# They can be used in all weather
# The proposal was previously aired at a summer meeting in Portugal where a show of hands indicated support.
# At the latest meeting, in Walsall, chairmen viewed a presentation at which costs of installing a Fifa two-star-rated 3G surface were examined, along with a variety of other factors including injury rates and competition balance.
# Again, they were asked to vote and 29 out of 46 members said they would back the re-introduction.
# Rules are now expected to be drawn up and a formal vote on whether to allow them from the start of next season will be taken at the next meeting in November.
# Artificial surfaces were allowed in the FA Cup earlier this year.
# Plastic pitches
# Loftus Road, home of QPR, was the first English ground to lay a plastic pitch in 1981. It stayed until 1988
# Preston North End were the last of four clubs to try the experiment, putting theirs down in 1986 before ripping it up in 1994
# Non-league Hyde lasted until 1995 before replacing theirs
# Oldham Athletic won promotion to the top flight while using a plastic pitch in 1991
# The vote is also expected to allow the plastic pitches to be used in the Capital One Cup and Johnstone's Paint Trophy.
# Plastic pitches were banned from English professional football after four clubs - QPR, Luton Town, Oldham Athletic and Preston North End - tried them during the 1980s.
# In July, Conference clubs voted to allow 3G pitches into all three divisions from the 2015/16 season.
# English Premiership rugby union sides Saracens and Newcastle and Pro-12 side Cardiff Blues have all installed artificial surfaces, while Super League's Widnes Vikings use one at the Select Security Stadium."""
